= Applying CDI on RESTful web services

Learn how to apply Contexts and Dependency Injection on a REST service application in Open Liberty to manage scopes and inject dependencies.

== What you'll Learn

You will learn how to use CDI in a simple inventory management application that contains two RESTful web services.
These are the `system` and `inventory` services.
They are provided to you in this guide.
If you want to learn how to build a RESTful web service, you can follow
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service] guide
which has detail instructions on how to build the `system` service.
The `inventory` service is similar, thus it's provided as a starting point for you in this guide.

You will apply Contexts and Dependency Injection on a single application that acts as an `inventory` service,
storing the information about various JVMs running on different hosts.

The `inventory` service has an entry for a particular host if that host exposes its
JVM's system properties via another RESTful web service, which you can refer to
as the `system` service. Whenever a request is made to the `inventory` service to retrieve the JVM
system properties of a particular host, the `inventory` service will communicate with the `system`
service to get these system properties. The system properties are then stored and returned.

You will use CDI to inject dependencies into the application and you will learn how to manage the lifecycle of your objects.

The `system` and `inventory` services that you will use in this application are provided for you under `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/system`.

The following diagram shows the overall layout of the inventory application:

[#diagram]
.When a request is sent to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/{hostname}, the `inventory` service attempts to talk to `system` service running on hostname to retrieve its JVM system properties.
These properties are then stored and returned. The `system` service can be run on any other server and the results are returned back to the `inventory` service.

=== What is CDI?

Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines a rich set of complementary services that improve the application structure.
The most fundamental services provided by CDI are Contexts (bind the lifecycle of stateful components to well-defined lifecycle contexts)
and Dependency Injection (the ability to inject components into an application in a typesafe way).

With CDI, the container does all the daunting work of instantiating dependencies, giving us, the developers,
the ability to inject components into an application in a typesafe way. Moreover, CDI also makes it
possible to bind the lifecycle and interactions of stateful components to well-defined contexts,
controlling exactly when and how these components are instantiated and destroyed.

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-cdi-intro.git
cd guide-cdi-intro/start
----

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished inventory application. Feel
free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then run the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts. This is the staring point of the `inventory`
service and it displays the current contents of the inventory. As you might expect, these are empty since
nothing is stored in the inventory yet. Next, point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/localhost.
You see a JSON with the system properties of your local JVM. By visiting this URL, these system
properties are automatically stored in the inventory. Go back to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts and
you see a new entry for `localhost`. For simplicity, only the OS name and username are shown here for
each host. You can repeat this process for your own hostname or any other local machine that is running
the `system` service.

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.


== Creating the inventory management application

First, let's break down the different components your application will be made out of, as well as which
technologies each component will use.

1. You will need an inventory manager that edits the inventory contents, adding new entries,
removing old entries, and so on. CDI is used in this component to handle the interactions in order to
establish a loosely coupled infrastructure.

2. You will need a means of establishing communication between the client and the inventory manager.
This is simply done by injecting the inventory manager bean into the inventory resource using CDI.

The results you will see from the two services are provided as JSON objects.

=== Creating the inventory manager bean

The inventory manager bean is responsible for storing and retrieving various JVM system properties.

For this bean, use a simple Java Collection to store JSON objects. A more advanced application should
use a database to persist all the data, but in this example it's not necessary.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryManager.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

Your inventory is ultimately just a `ConcurrentMap` object where the key is a hostname and the value
is a JSON Java object full of various JVM system properties.

The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation on the class is a CDI API and it indicates that this particular
bean is to be initialized once per the application scope. Intuitively, since the `ConcurrentMap` object
is essentially our database, we want the inventory manger bean to be persistent between all the clients.
By making it application-scoped, the container ensures that the same instance of the bean is used whenever
its injected in the application.

Your inventory manager bean contains two simple methods for retrieving (`get`) entries from the inventory
and listing (`list`) all entries currently stored in the inventory.

Use JSON-P to process all of the JSON objects.

Finally, we are giving you two utility components: a `InventoryUtil` class and the `JsonMessages` enum.
Both of these can be found under `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/util`.

- The `InventoryUtil` class is responsible for communicating with the `system` service to retrieve JVM
system properties for a particular host that exposes them.
- The `JsonMessages` enum is used to build JSON Java objects for various error cases. Currently its
only used to build an error JSON whenever a particular host does not exist or is not running the `system` service.

Both of these contain detailed Javadocs, so feel free to read them for reference.


=== Adding injection into the inventory resource

The inventory resource is a RESTful service that is served at the `hosts` endpoint. It enables the client to
communicate with the inventory manager via HTTP methods.

Reference to `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=**;!copyright]
----

First and foremost, the `@Inject` annotation indicates a dependency injection.
In this case, you are injecting your `InventoryManager` bean.
This injects the bean in its specified context (application-scoped) and makes all of its functionalities
available without the need of instantiating it yourself.

The `@RequestScoped` annotation on the class is also a CDI API and it indicates that this bean is
to be initialized once for every request. In other words, the bean is instantiated when the request
is received and destroyed when a response is sent back to the client. Note that while this bean can
also be application-scoped, request scope is short-lived and is therefore ideal for HTTP requests.

Let's break down the methods in this REST service to understand how the application work:

- `getPropertiesForHost` returns the JVM system properties for the specific host by calling the injected
`InventoryManager` bean.
- `listContents` returns a JSON with the current contents of the inventory. This method also calls
the injected `InventoryManager` bean.

Lastly, the `InventoryApplication` wrapper class groups all resources under a common endpoint.

Your inventory application is now finished.


// =================================================================================================
// Building the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

// include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal from the command line:

```
mvn install
```

This goal builds the application and creates a `.war` file in the target directory. The goal also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.

Next, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven `pom.xml` is already configured to start
the application in this server instance.

You can find the `inventory` and `system` services at:

- http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
- http://localhost:9080/system/properties

// include::{common-includes}/mvnpackage.adoc[]

If you make changes to the code, use the Maven `package` goal to rebuild the application and have the
running Open Liberty server pick them up automatically:

```
mvn package
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```


// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the inventory application

While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests since they will trigger
a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment
for you to write tests.

Begin by creating a test class `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testClass;!copyright;!tests;!helpers]
----

The `@BeforeClass` annotation is placed on a method that executes before any of the test cases.
In this case, the `oneTimeSetup` method retrieves the port number for the Open Liberty server and builds
a base URL string that is used throughout the tests.

The `@Before` and `@After` annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test case.
These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the `setup` method
creates a JAX-RS client which makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service. This client must
also be registered with a JSON-P provider (`JsrJsonpProvider`) to process JSON resources. The `teardown`
method simply destroys this client instance.

Next, add a few test case methods to test the functionality of your inventory application. Start by
creating a method that verifies that the inventory is initially empty when the server first starts up:

Create `testEmptyInventory()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testEmptyInventory]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that a host is correctly added to the inventory.

Create `testHostRegistration()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testHostRegistration]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that the JVM system properties returned by the `system` service match
the ones stored in the `inventory` service.

Create `testSystemPropertiesMatch()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSystemPropertiesMatch]
----

Finally, create a method that verifies that an unknown host or a host that does not expose their JVM system
properties is correctly handled as an error.

Create `testUnknownHost()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testUnknownHost]
----

To force these test cases to execute in a particular order, put them in a test "suite" method and label
it with a `@Test` annotation so that it automatically executes when your test class run.

Create `testSuite()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSuite]
----

One last bit is to add the unimplemented helper methods that are used throughout the tests:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java[tags=helpers;!javadoc]
----

Complete Javadocs for these helper methods are available under the `finish` directory for reference:
`finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/EndpointTest.java`.


=== Running the tests

// include::{common-includes}/mvnverify.adoc[]

If the server is still running from the previous steps, stop it first using the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Then, verify that the tests pass using the Maven `verify` goal:

```
mvn verify
```

It may take some time before build is complete. If the tests pass, you will see an output similar to the following:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.128 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory.EndpointTest

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

To see whether the tests detect a failure, change the endpoint for the `inventory` service in
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java` to something else, then
re-run the Maven build. You will see a test failure occur.


== Great work! You're done!
